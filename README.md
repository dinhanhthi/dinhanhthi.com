# dinhanhthi.com [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ace14869-1b28-471b-ad0f-5f1f7defa382/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/inspiring-goldstine-cfc130/deploys)

üëã Thi's personal website running on 11ty.

‚ùó **Note** : This repo is for my personal purpose ONLY. Although I used to wanna make this be an 11ty theme for others to be able to use but the complexity and my free time prevent me to continue. If you can find yourself how to use it, it's great, otherwise, just ask me but I cannot promise that I will reply (soon) üôÅ. Anyway, if you find something useful for me to enhance this theme, just let me know, many thanks.

üìö Markdown notes are stored in [a separated repo](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/notes).

## Changelog

üëâ  Read this [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Older versions

There are several "old" versions (mainly built on **Jekyll**) with different themes.

üëâ Version 1 (Jekyll): [v1.dinhanhthi.com](https://v1.dinhanhthi.com) -- [source](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com-v1).<br />
üëâ Version 2 (Jekyll): [v2.dinhanhthi.com](https://v2.dinhanhthi.com) -- [source](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com-v2).<br />
üëâ Version 3 (Jekyll): [v3.dinhanhthi.com](https://v3.dinhanhthi.com) -- [source](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com-v3).

## Dev

Suppose that the installation step is done completely.

- **Update data** : modify files in `notes/_data/`. Files need to be duplicated in both `notes/_data` and `src/_data`: `helpers.js`, `settings.json`, `env.js`, `csp.js`, `googleanalytics.js`.
- **Update posts** : just modify things in `notes/`. For testing locally `sample:*`, modify in `sample_posts/`.
- **Header icon** (frontmatter):
  - `icon: aio.svg`: icon has to be stored in `notes/img/header/`.
  - `icon: /src/img_src/aio.svg`: icon has to be stored in `/src/img/header/` (Yes, it's `img_src`!!!). It's useful for sample posts (we don't have to store icons on `/notes/`)

Without image processing,

```bash
# Sample posts (sample_posts/)
npm run sample:watch-no-opt # localhost:8080, built to "_built"
# Wait for finishing the built and run
npm run css:touch

# Real posts (/notes/posts/)
npm run full:watch-no-opt # localhost:8080, built to "_built"
# Wait for finishing the built and run
npm run css:touch
```

With image processing,

```bash
# Sample posts (sample_posts/)
npm run sample:watch-opt # localhost:8080, built to "_site"
# Wait for finishing the built and run
npm run css:touch

# Just build sample_post
npm run sample:build-opt # built to "_site"

# Real posts (/notes/posts/)
npm run build # built to "_site"
npm run full:http-serve-opt # localhost:8081 over "_live" (a copied of "_site")

# Build and http serve real posts
npm run full:build-http-serve-opt
```

‚ùó Sometimes, css/js watch don't work, need to run these separatedly,

```bash
npm run css:watch-local
# Need to save some css codes to make this watch run!
npm run js:build-watch
```

```bash
# Build & update & deploy
npm run site:build-update

# Just build
npm run build # _site

# Just update & deploy what built in _site
npm run site:update
```

### Download SVG from flaticon

Normally, you cannot download SVG format from flaticon. Just click on Edit > Open Inspect Element > Copy SVG HTML element > Create a new file + paste this + save as `.svg`.

### Update Fontello icons?

Upload the config file in `/src/fontello/config.json` to [fontello.com](https://fontello.com/) (by clicking on the spanner symbol). Add more icons you want. After choosing, click to "**Get config only**".

```bash
# Install fontello-cli
npm install -g fontello-cli

# Remove old session (if changing the current icons, not adding new ones)
rm .fontello-session

# Install / update new icon
fontello-cli --config src/fontello/config.json --css src/fontello/css --font src/fontello/font install

# Check code in src/fontello/config.json, field "css"
```

```html
<!-- How to use? -->
<i class="fontello-icon icon-ng"></i>
```

**Note**: Sometimes, there are duplicates hexa/decimal code (although the names are different). On fontello website, navigate to "Customize Codes" tab, find duplicates and change them. Note that, in this tab, the codes are shown in hexa base but in the downlowded config, the codes are shown in decimal based (field `"code"`). You can use [this site](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) to convert between them.

## Installation

<details>
<summary>Click to show (a little long)!</summary>

At the first time after cloning,

```bash
# Install nodejs
# https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions

npm i # Run once

sh getting_start.sh # Run once
```

```bash
# Any problem with sharp?
# Try to change the python path to python2
# Best practice: create a python env containing python just for this task!

# In case, python2 installed but it's not currently default
# Choose python version in npm with
npm config set python python2
```

```bash
# Problems with libvips (MacOS??)? => install it first
brew install vips
# Then again,
npm i
```

Dev mode,

```bash
# Install before
sudo npm install http-server -g

# Create \_live & Clone dat.com/\_site
sh getting_started.sh
```

Check section [Dev](#dev) for more.

```bash
# Make a shortcut on the system?
update_dat='cd ~/git/dinhanhthi.com && sh ud_site.sh && cd -1'
```

</details>

### Re-install?

In case have some problems and need to re-install everything,

```bash
npm run re-install
```

It will remove `node_modules/`, `package-lock.json` and re-run `npm i`.

## Errors?

```bash
# 'darwin-arm64v8' binaries cannot be used on the 'darwin-x64' platform
rm -rf node_modules/sharp
npm  i
# or: https://bit.ly/3kyzXiL
# npm install --arch=x64 --platform=darwin sharp
```

```bash
# connect EADDRNOTAVAIL 127.0.0.1:8080 - Local (192.168.1.109:50781)
# (Usually after install WARP on MacOS)
sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 192.0.2.2
```
