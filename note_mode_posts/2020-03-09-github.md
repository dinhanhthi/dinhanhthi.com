In case you have multiple accounts, you have to indicate separatedly the account in each repository,

```bash
git config user.name "Thi"
git config user.email "dinhanhthi@gmail.com"

If 2 accounts on 2 different platforms,

```bash
# ~/.ssh/config
# Default github account: dinhanhthi@gmail.com
Host github.com

   IdentitiesOnly yes

# Other github account: thi@ideta.io
Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ideta

```

If 2 accounts on the same platforms, eg. Github

```bash
Host *
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.thi
	AddKeysToAgent yes

Host *
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.ideta
	AddKeysToAgent yes

{% hsbox "If you use [zsh](/terminal/#zsh-linux)?"%}

It's important on linux, otherwise, you won't be able to use ssh-agent in zsh environment

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
plugins=(git ssh-agent)

update_ssh(){
	eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.ideta
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.thi
}
alias ud_ssh='update_ssh'
```

Everytime you have problems, just `ud_ssh`.

::: hsbox Reset ssh-agent on terminal

```bash
# Delete all cached keys (be careful)
ssh-add -D

# Be careful, it will reset and use different agent!!!!
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ideta

# Check saved keys
ssh-add -l

## Info

- Commits to a **fork** don't appear in your contributions graph.
- Commits to a generated from **template** can appear in your contributions graph.
- Get size of a github repo: `https://api.github.com/repos/<user>/<repo>` then find property "size". The size is in KB.

## Repo template

::: hsbox Archived on 14/10/21

I wanna make a theme `notetheme2` based on [dinhanhthi.com](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com).

1. Make `dinhanhthi.com` be a template (Go to _Settings_)
2. Create a new repo based on this template.
3. Create a new branch `notetheme2` on `dinhanhthi.com`. Make changes on this branch.
4. Everything we have a "theme change" on `dinhanhthi.com/master`, merge it to branch `dinhanhthi.com/notetheme2`.
5. If there are **files** (only for files) in `dinhanhthi.com/notetheme2` you wanna keep, add below line to `.gitattributes` (under branch `dinhanhthi.com/notetheme2`) before performing the merge,

   ```bash
   # add line to .gitattributes
   echo 'file_name.txt merge=ours' >> .gitattributes
   # on windows, remove `''`
   ```

6. If there are **folders** (or **files**) in `dinhanhthi.com/notetheme2` you **don't wanna keep** (from `/master`), just delete them and make a new commit. From this time, later merges will ignore them.
7. If there are **folders** in `/notethem2` you wanna **keep the current state** (instead of merging from master), create a script `reset_folders.sh`

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   # used for branch notetheme2 only
   echo 'Reset some only-this-branch folders after merging.'
   git reset folder_1 folder_2
   git checkout .
   git add .
   git commit -m "update from master"
   ```

   Each time you run the merge, run

   ```bash
   git merge master && sh reset_folders.sh
   ```

8. Update changes from `dinhanhthi.com/notetheme2` to repo `notetheme2`{% ref "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56577184/github-pull-changes-from-a-template-repository/56577320" %}.

   ```bash
   # add dinhanhthi.com as a remote
   git remote add template [URL of the template repo]
   ```

   ```bash
   # update the changes
   git fetch --all
   ```

   ```bash
   # update from template's branch
   git merge template/notetheme2
   ```

9. If there is an error `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`, try to add `--allow-unrelated-histories`. There must be [conflict](#conflict).

   ```bash
   # keep remotes
   git merge -X theirs template/notetheme2 --allow-unrelated-histories
   # keep local
   git merge -X ours template/notetheme2 --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

## Add Shields tags

ðŸ‘‰ Main shield site [here](https://shields.io/).
ðŸ‘‰ Example of usage: [my main github page](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi).

```bash
# scikit-learn badge
http://img.shields.io/badge/-Scikit%20Learn-efa300?style=flat-square&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=fff
# ...<NAME>-<Background-Color>?style...&logo=<LOGO>&logoColor=<LOGO-COLOR>
```

- Logo name can be found at [simpleicon](https://simpleicons.org/?q=node). If the name includes spaces, replace them with dashes (e.g: `?logo=visual-studio-code`)
- Wanna create a custom logo?
  - Change SVG to PNG if needed: use [this site](https://svgtopng.com/).
  - Change logo's color to white: use [this site](https://manytools.org/image/colorize-filter/).
  - Must resize the image to 14x14: use [this site](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image).
  - Convert to base64 file: use [this site](https://b64.io/), then copy `data:image/png;base64,iVB...` and paste after `&logo=`

## Errors

`fatal: Authentication failed for`: It's because you enabled two-factor authentication in your Github account.

1. Generate a new token: [click here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Copy that token and use it as a new password.

---

```bash
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: No route to host
fatal: Could not read from remote repository
```

```bash
# solution
nano ~/.ssh/config
# add following
Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
# run again to check
ssh -T git@github.com
```

`push declined due to email privacy restrictions`

This problem happens when you set your email to private (Go to `https://github.com/settings/emails`, you clicked on "Keep my email addresses private"). When you tick on this option, Github will generate an alternative email ("noreply" email) for you, eg. `10611116+youraccount@users.noreply.github.com`. **What you should do** to make this email work with the `git push`:

1. Make sure the repo you are working all is linked with this new email.

   ```bash
   # Check email you use in the current project
   cd <current-project>
   cat .git/config
   
   # If above doesn't have any email, it means you are using the global
   # Check the global
   git config user.email
   
   # You must: 
   # either change the current project to "noreply" email
   cd <current-project>
   git config user.email <noreply-email>
   # or change the global
   git config --global user.email <noreply-email>
   ```

2. Make sure ALL the commits you are going to push are assigned to new email (It means that the things you have just commited were assigned to the old email)

   ```bash
   # If you only have 1 commit assigned to the old email
   # Reset it
   git reset --soft HEAD~1 
   ```
