## Important Constraints

- **Git operations**: NEVER use git commands in this project - user handles all git operations manually
- **Answer in Vietnamese** but keep the code and terminology in English
- **Package Manager**: Always use `pnpm`, never `npm` or `yarn`
- **Architecture**: All utilities in `src/lib/`, NOT `src/app/lib/`
- **Imports**: Use `@/src/lib/*` for utilities, `@/src/app/components/*` for components
- Don't automatically generate summary document after each task unless you are asked to do so.
- Don't automatically run `pnpm run build` after each task unless you are asked to do so.
