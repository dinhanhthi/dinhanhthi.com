👉 **Blog**: ["Blog" vs "Notes" on this site?](/blog-vs-note/)

There are some facts:

{:.indent}
1. The notes are **not tutorials**!
2. The notes are **not written by a professional** but by a bookworm.
3. The notes are **not perfect**!
4. The notes are **always updated** without notice!
5. The notes **always give the sources** if the ideas are not mine!
6. The notes sometimes **contain errors**, so why I need your [help to correct them](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com/discussions).
7. The notes have **new brothers** every day.
8. The notes with **the little dot** (<sup>•</sup>) at the end of the title are **not good enough**!
9. You can share and keep the notes **for free**, but **not for commercial purposes**!
10. The page is created with [**11ty**](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Thank you and welcome to my world of notes.
