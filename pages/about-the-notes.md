There are some facts:

{:.indent}
1. The notes are **not tutorials**!
2. The notes are **not written by a pro** but a bookworm.
3. The notes are **not perfect**!
4. The notes are **always updated** without notice!
5. The notes **always indicate the sources** if the ideas are not mine!
6. The notes sometimes **contain mistakes**, that's why I need your [help to fix them](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com/discussions).
7. The notes have **new brothers** day by day.
8. The notes with **small dot** (<sup>â€¢</sup>) at the end of the title are **not good enough**!
9. The notes are **free to share**, to keep, but **not for commercial purposes**!
10. The site is built with [**11ty**](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Thanks and welcome to my world of notes.
