I'm **Thi**, a Vietnamese guy who has a curious mind. As an never-stop-learning mathematician, I am interested in researching and sharing contents about *applied maths* with its applications, *computer science* and *software tools* which are helpful to human life. I have a **Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics** at [University Paris 13](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr){:target="_blank"}, France.

After my Ph.D., I am **currently working as a Data Scientist** at [Dataswati](https://www.dataswati.com/). I use [this website]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/notes) and [this one](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com "My personal notes"){:target="_blank"} to document everything I learned while going through the process of learning and working in this field. I also like to write about intuitive maths. I'm an admin of **[Math2IT](https://math2it.com){:target="_blank"}**, a Vietnamese community about maths, education, and technology.

My hobbies are [drawing](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9OVEkdTjmtRPg7vC3){:target="_blank"}, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19630622-thi-dinh){:target="_blank"} and [cooking](https://goo.gl/photos/yQXdQws1LLS16x5v5){:target="_blank"}.

{% include heading-title.html title="Ph.D. Research" icon="fas fa-graduation-cap" %}

I researched on the growth of [biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm){:target="_blank"} by using [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method){:target="_blank"}, [Level Set Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level-set_method){:target="_blank"} and some other numerical ones for an interface problem. For the implementation and simulation, I first used [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/){:target="_blank"} and later developed by myself the **[NXFEM](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/nxfem){:target="_blank"}**, a Matlab toolbox.

- **3 presentations** about biofilm growth model & numrical methods & application of FreeFem++.
- **6 conferences** about biofilm & biology & numerical methods.
- **1 additional project** proposed by [IFPEN](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/){:target="_blank"} in 11th Semaine d'Étude Maths-Entreprises ([SEME](https://www.agence-maths-entreprises.fr/a/?q=fr/node/13){:target="_blank"}).
