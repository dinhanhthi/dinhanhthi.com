## Infor & Preface

- Full name: **You Don't Know JS Yet** (2nd edition)
- Author: **Kyle Simpson**
- [getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) on Github
- It's not just for starters, but ==for all developers== who want to understand deeper.
- "_The primary point of the title “You Don’t Know JS Yet” is to point out that most JS developers don’t take the time to really understand how the code that they write works._"
- "_My suggestion is you take your time going through YDKJSY. Take one chapter, read it completely through start to finish, and then go back and re-read it section by section. Stop in between each section, and practice the code or ideas from that section. For larger concepts, it probably is a good idea to expect to spend several days ==digesting, re-reading, practicing==, then digesting some more._"

## Chap 1 — What is JS?

### What's With That Name?

- Not related with Java at all, not just a script but a programming language.
- "Java" → attract mostlty Java programmers, "Script" → lighweight.
- Official name specified by [TC39](https://tc39.es/) as "**ECMAScript" (ES).**
- ==JS in browsers or Node.js is an implementation of ES2019 standard==.
- Hosted by ECMA.
- Don't use "JS6" or "ES8", use "ES20xx" or "JS".

### Language Specification

- Who decides a new version of JS? → ==[TC39](https://tc39.es/)== (~50-100 members) by votes via [5 stages](https://tc39.es/process-document/).
- There is **just one JS** in the wild (not multiple versions).
- **Environments run JS**: browsers, servers, robots, lightbulbs,....
- Not all are JS, eg. `alert("Hello, JS!")` or `console.log()` ← they're just APIs of JS environments.
  - There are many "JS-looking" APIs: `fetch()`, `getCurrentLocation()`, `getUserMedia()`,...
  - They follow JS rules but just "guests", not official JS specifications.
- Complain "_JS is so inconsistent_!" ← it's because the environment hehaviors work, not because of JS itself!
- **Developer Tools** (Inspect Element in Chrome, for example) are... tools for developers. They're NOT JS environment!
  - ==Something works in Dev Tool, doesn't mean JS compiler will understand it.==

### Many Faces

- **Paradigm-level code categories**
  - _Procedural_: organizes codes in a top-down, linear progression. ← eg. C
  - _Object-oriented_ (OO/classes): organizes codes into classes. ← eg. Java/C++
  - _Functional_ (FP): organizes codes into functions. ← eg. Haskell
  - ==JS is a _multi-paradigm_ language.== => "*meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms*"

### Backwards & Forwards

- **Backwards compatibility**:
  
  - ==Code from the past should still work today== — "_we don't break the web_" (TC39)
  - <u>Idea</u>: JS developer can write code with confidence → their code won't stop working in new released versions.
  - Once it’s in JS, it can’t be taken out because it might break programs, even if we’d
    really, really like to remove it!
- **Forward compatibility**:
  - ==Code from future don't break the web today==. ← tip to remember "forward"
  - CSS & HTML is forward, not backward!
  - Codes from the past may not work / work the same today.
  - Feature from 2019 in a browser 2010 => page isn't broken! Unrecognized things will be skipped!

- ==JS is backwards compatibility + not forward compability==
  - Codes written today, will work in future JS engines.
  - Codes written today may be broken in old JS engines.

- **Why**?
  - "Markup" (HTML) / "Styling" (CSS) languages => easier to "skip over".
  - "Programming language" (JS) => cannot skip something it doesn't understand (the rest may be effected!)

- **Fill the gaps?**

  - JS has "forward-compability problems" (FC) (not compatible with old engines)
  - How today codes can be used in an old engine? => use ==**transpiling**== (using a tool to convert a source code of a program from one form to another)
  - FC problems **related syntax** => use a **transpiler** (eg. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) -- ==convert "new" JS syntax to "older" syntax.==

      ::: col-2-equal
      ```js
      // New
      if (something) {
          let x = 3; // "let" was added in ES6 (2015)
          console.log(x);
      } else {
          let x = 4; // "let" => block scope
          console.log(x);
      }
      ```

      ```js
      // Old
      var x$0, x$1; // different variables
      if (something) {
          x$0 = 3; // diferent variables
          console.log(x$0);
      } else {
          x$1 = 4;
          console.log(x$1);
      }
      ```
      :::

  -  "*It’s strongly ==recommended that developers use the latest version of JS== so that their code is clean and communicates its ideas most effectively.*" <= Let the tools take care of converting.

  - FC problems **related to missing API method** => use **==polyfill==** (aka "shim"). <= Normally, a transpiler like Babel will detect and add it automatically.

    ```js
    // NEW: .finally() <= ES2019
    // getSomeRecords() returns us a promise for some // data it will fetch
    var pr = getSomeRecords();
    // show the UI spinner while we get the data
    startSpinner();
    pr.then(renderRecords) // render if successful
      .catch(showError) // show an error if not
      .finally(hideSpinner) // always hide the spinner
    ```

    ```js
    // OLD:
    if (!Promise.prototype.finally) { // prevents running on engine alrady has this API
      Promise.prototype.finally = function f(fn){ // define new for old engines
    		return this.then(
          function t(v){
    				return Promise.resolve( fn() )
            	.then(function t(){
    						return v; });
    					}, function c(e){}
        );
    	};
    }
    ```

### What's in an Interpretation?

![img]({{ img-url }}/img-20211030155326706.png){:.img-60}
*[Source](https://techytalks007.blogspot.com/2016/08/let-us-know-what-are-difference-between.html).*

- To clearify JS is interpreted or compiled => see how errors are handled.

- Historically, scripted/interpreted languages were executed a top-down, line-by-line

  ![image-20211030214022778]({{ img-url }}/image-20211030214022778.png){:.img-80}
  *Interpreted./Scripted Execution. Lines 1-4 must be executed before finding an error in line 5.*
  
- **Parsing** whole process before any execution,

  ![image-20211030214228849]({{ img-url }}/image-20211030214228849.png){:.img-70}
  *Parsing + Compilation + Execution. An error in line 5 would be caught in parsing phase before any execution.*
  
- "Parsed" language 🤝 "compiled" language: All compiled are parsed.

- JS code is parsed before it's executed. => =="early errors"== => **JS is a parsed language**

- **==JS is closer to compiled than interpreted==** (but not clearly a compiled or clearly a interpreted) => "*meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.*"

- **Flow of a JS source program**:

  ![image-20211030215050566]({{ img-url }}/image-20211030215050566.png){:.img-70}
  *Parsing, Compiling, and Executing JS.*
  
  1. Program leaves IDE => transpiled by Babel => packed by Webpack => ... => **form1** => delivered to a JS engine.
  2. JS engine parses the code to an AST (*Abstract Syntax Tree*) <= subsequent execution: form1 > AST > executable form.
  3. Engine convert that AST to a kind-of byte code => then to JIT (*just in time*) compiler.
  4. JS VM executes the program.
  
- **Web Assembly (WASM)** => ==augments what the web (including JS) can accomplish.==

  - 2013, "**ASM.js**" (a subset of JS lang, *transpiled from C*) was introduced (by Mozilla) to demonstrate the performance of JS engine where it can run an Unreal 3 game at full 60fps. => ASM.js is just a transpiled language (not for coding).
  - After ASM.js > another group (also Mozilla's) released **Web Assembly (WASM)** <= provide a path for non-JS program (like C) to be converted to a form that could run in the JS engine.
    - ==WASM's format is entirely unlike JS== => skipping the parsing/compilation JS engine normally does
    - codes => WASM parsing/compilation => binary packed (easier for JS engine to understand) > JS engine execute them.
    - <u>Ex</u>: Go program has threaded programming => WASM convert it => JS engine can understand (JS no need to have something like threads feature)
    - 💡TC39 aren't stressed to add more features (from other "component" languages) => just keep their rules, WASM will make the bridge.
  - ==WASM isn't only for the web, also isn't JS==.

### *Strictly* Speaking

- ES5 (2009) => "**strict mode**" => encourage better JS programs.

- **Why**?

  - Not a restriction but rather a "guide" so that JS engine can optimize and effectciently run the code.
  - Prevent some "stupid" coding ways when working in group, for example.

- In form of "*early errors*" => ex: disallows naming 2 function parameters the same.

- Some examples

  ```js
  // only whitespace and comments are allowed
  // before the use-strict pragma
  "use strict";
  // the rest of the file runs in strict mode
  ```

  ```js
  // Per function scope
  // Used when you wanna convert non-strict to strict programs
  function someOperations() {
    // whitespace and comments are fine here "use strict";
    // all this code will run in strict mode
  }
  ```

- Cannot be default => otherwise, it will break "backward compatibility" rule.
- ==Virtually, all transpiled codes (codes in production) ends up in strict mode.==



## Chap 2 — Surveying JS

- The best way to learn JS is to start writing JS.
- ==**Goal**: get a better *feel*== for it, so that we can move forward writing our own programs with more confidence.

### Each File is a Program

- In JS, ==each standalone file is its own separate program==. <= for error handling.
- How multiple files talk together? => <u>Only way</u>: sharing their **state** + use "**global scope**".
- ES6 => **module** (also a file-based) <= files are imported to module and be considered as a single module.
  - JS does still treat each module separately
- A JS file: either *standardlone* or *module*.

### Value

- Values come in 2 forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**

- **Primitive**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `null`, `symbol`

  - *literals*: `string`, `number`, `boolean`

    - `string` literals, eg: `const name = "Thi."` <= Using `""` or `''` is optional but ==should pick one and to use it consistently throughout the program.==

      ```js
      // Also can use backtick ``
      console.log("My name is ${name}.") // My name is ${name}.
      console.log(`My name is ${name}.`) // My name is Thi.
      ```

      This is called **interpolation**

    - `number`, eg. `3.14` or `Math.PI`
    - `boolean`: `true`, `false`.

  - The "emptiness": **undefined**, **null** (they're not the same) => ==it’s safest and best to use only `undefined` as the single empty value==
  - `symbol`, eg. `const a = Symbol("meaning of life")` <= Symbols are mostly used in low-level code such as in libraries and frameworks.

- <u>Fact</u>: JS array indices are 0-based (eg. `a[0]`)

- **Arrays**:

  ```js
  names = ["France", 1, null]
  names.length // 3
  names[0] // France
  typeof names // "object" <= yep!
  
  // array can contains a function
  const func = () => true;
  arr = [func, 1]
  typeof func // "function"
  ```

- **Objects**: an unordered, keyed collection of any various values

  ```js
  name = {
    first: "Thi",
    last: "Dinh",
    age: 30,
    specialties: [ "JS", "Drawing" ]
  };
  console.log(`My name is ${ name.first }.`); // My name is Thi.
  ```

- **Value Type Determination**:

  ```js
  typeof 42;									// "number"
  typeof "abc";								// "string"
  typeof true;								// "boolean"
  typeof undefined;						// "undefined"
  typeof null;								// "object" <= yep!
  typeof { "a": 1 };					// "object"
  typeof [1,2,3];							// "object" <= yep!
  typeof function hello(){}; 	// "function"
  ```

### **Declaring and Using Variables**

- `var` vs `let`

  ```js
  var adult = true;
  if (adule) {
    var name = "Thi"; // <= "var" says "this variable will be seen by a wider scope"
    let age = 30; // <= "let" limit access to "block scope"
  }
  console.log(name) // Thi
  console.log(age) // Error!
  ```

  **Note**: ==`var` should be avoided in favor of `let` (or `const`)== => prevent confusing in scoping behaviors.

- `let` vs `const` <= must give `const` an initial value and cannot re-assign.

  ```js
  const somethingToBeAssignedLater; // Error!
  const myBirthday = true;
  let age;
  age = 30;
  if (myBirthday) {
  	age=age+1; //OK!
    myBirthday = false; // Error!
  }
  ```

- However,

  ```js
  ```
