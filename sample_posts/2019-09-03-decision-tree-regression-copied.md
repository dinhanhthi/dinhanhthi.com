## What's the idea of Decision Tree Regression?

The basic intuition behind a decision tree is to map out all possible decision paths in the form of a tree. It can be used for *classification* ([note](/decision-tree-classifier)) and *regression*. In this post, let's try to understand the regression.

DT Regression is similar to [**DT Classification**](/decision-tree-classifier), however we use **Mean Square Error** (MSE, default) or **Mean Absolute Error** (MAE) instead of *cross-entropy* or *Gini impurity* to determine splits.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{MSE} &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y}_i)^2, \\
\text{MAE} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \vert y_i - \bar{y}_i \vert.
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose that we have a dataset $S$ like in the figure below,

<div class="columns-2" markdown="1">

*An example of dataset $S$.*

### Some basic concepts

![Concepts with a tree.]({{img-url}}/r3.jpg){:.img-full-85}

- **Splitting**: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- **Pruning**: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning.
- **Parent node and Child Node**: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node.

::: warning
Looking for an example like in [the post of decision tree classifier](/decision-tree-classifier)? Check [this](/files/ml/saedsayad.com_Decision_Tree_Regression.pdf)! Below are a short algorithm,
:::

1. Calculate the **Standard Deviation** ($SD$) of the current node (let's say $S$, parent node) by using MSE or MAE,

    $$\begin{aligned}SD(S) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y}_i)^2, \\\text{or  } SD(S) &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \vert y_i - \bar{y}_i \vert,\end{aligned}$$

    where $y_i\in$ the target values (*Hours Played* in the above example), $\bar{y}=\frac{\Sigma y}{n}$ is the mean value and $n$ is the number of examples **in this node**.
2. Check the **stopping conditions** (we don't need to make any split at this node) to stop the split and this node becomes a leaf node. Otherwise, go to step 3.

    - The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, use `min_samples_split` in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor).
    - The maximum depth of the tree, use `max_depth` in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor).
    - A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value, use `min_impurity_decrease` in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor).
    - Its *coefficient of variation* ($\frac{SD(S)}{\bar{y}}$) is less than a certain threshold.
3. Calculate the **Standard Deviation Reduction** (SDR) after splitting node $S$ on each attribute (for example, consider attribute $O$). The attribute w.r.t. the biggest SDR will be chosen!

    $$\underbrace{SDR(S,O)}_{\text{Standard Deviation Reduction}}= \underbrace{SD(S)}_{\text{SD before split}}- \underbrace{\sum_j P(O_j | S) \times SD(S,O_j)}_{\text{weighted SD after split}}$$

    where $j \in$ number of different properties in $O$ and $P(O_j)$ is the propability of property $O_j$ in $O$. Note that, $SD(S,O_j)$ means the SD of node $O_j$ which is also a child of node $S$.
4. After splitting, we have new child nodes. Each of them becomes a new parent node in the next step. Go back to step 1.

## Using Decision Tree Regression with Scikit-learn

### Load and create

Load the library,

~~~ python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
~~~

Create a decision tree ([other parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor)):

~~~ python
# mean squared error (default)
reg = DecisionTreeRegressor() # criterion='mse'
# mean absolute error
reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(criterion='mae')
~~~

An example,

::: code-output-equal
~~~ python
from sklearn import tree
X = [[0, 0], [2, 2]]
y = [0.5, 2.5]
reg = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()
reg = reg.fit(X, y) # train
~~~~

~~~
array([0.5])
~~~
:::

### Plot and save plots

Plot the tree (You may need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) first. Don't forget to add its installed folder to `$path`),

<div class="columns-2 size-2-1" markdown="1">

~~~ python
from IPython.display import Image
import pydotplus
dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(reg, out_file=None,
                                rounded=True,
                                filled=True)
graph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data)
Image(graph.create_png())
~~~

![An example.]({{img-url}}/r4.png){:.img-100 .pop}
</div>

Save the tree (follows the codes in "plot the tree")

~~~ python
graph.write_pdf("tree.pdf")   # to pdf
graph.write_png("thi.png")    # to png
~~~
